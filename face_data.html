        <h1>Nepali Celeb Localized Face Dataset</h1>
        <p>The dataset contains images of 49 famous individuals from Nepal, including actors, actresses, singers, and
            social figures. The individuals vary in age, gender, and profession.</p>
        <p>Potential uses for this dataset include face recognition, face detection, emotion recognition, and training
            machine learning models related to facial analysis.</p>
        <p>For more details and to access the dataset, visit <a

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Images of the actors were collected from the internet using a Python script.</li>
            <li>The <code>bing_image_downloader</code> package was used to download images.</li>
            <li>Images were manually verified for quality and unsuitable ones were removed.</li>
            <li>OpenCV library was used to detect faces and crop images to extract only the face region.</li>
            <li>The cropped face images were resized to a standard size.</li>
            <li>Processed images were saved in a separate directory with appropriate naming convention.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you're interested in the technical details, you can check out the dataset on Kaggle and review the Python
            scripts used for data collection and preprocessing.</p>
